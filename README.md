## Elliptic curves
This repository contains some useful code for elementary elliptic curve computations and some completed, some half-completed exercises from Silverman and Tate's Rational Points on Elliptic Curves. Note that the code for Lenstra's algorithm will not work. I hope to update this and the exercise page soon. Note that, for the exercises file, one requires [`jack.sty`](https://github.com/jackdeserrano/notes-and-writings/blob/main/texmf/tex/latex/jack.sty). There is a brief description of how it works [here](https://github.com/jackdeserrano/notes-and-writings#readme).
